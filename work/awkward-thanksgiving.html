				<h3>Awkward Thanksgiving</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>This is the first professional site I built. The website is for an independent film and was meant to generate excitement prior to release. I designed and implemented the site myself using mostly HTML5 and&nbsp;CSS.</p>
				<p>My favorite part of the project was watching it grow. I began building it half a year before the movie was scheduled and got to add features and content as the year went along. Being able to participate fully in this project gave me an appreciation of everything that goes into building a website, even at a small&nbsp;scale.</p>
