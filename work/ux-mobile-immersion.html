				<h3>UX Mobile Immersion 2015</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>This project is the website of the 2015 UX Mobile Immersion conference. I was involved with this project in a similar way as the User Interface 19 project. I built a few pages and I'm still responsible for content updates. I'm also involved in building a QA document for this site, as well as future instances of the UX Mobile Immersion conference&nbsp;website.</p>
				<p>The most interesting part of this project was a bug that we encountered. The site was built with Statamic and an issue occurred when content was added outside of the original scope. Seeing how a mid-project restructure can break a site was a good lesson to&nbsp;learn.</p>
